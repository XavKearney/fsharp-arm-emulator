# fsharp-arm-emulator
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional ARM Assembly Language Emulator in F#.

To run from a fresh clone, `cd` to the root directory and run:
`paket update`

This will install the necessary packages.

Then you can run the project at any time using:

`dotnet run --project ArmEmulator/ArmEmulator.fsproj`
