# fsharp-arm-emulator
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional ARM Assembly Language Emulator in F#.

If you don't have `paket` installed, run `.paket/paket.bootstrapper.exe` and then `.paket/paket.exe install`. `paket` should now be installed.

To run from a fresh clone, if you have `paket` installed then from the root directory run:
`paket update`

This will install the necessary packages.

Then you can run the project at any time using:

`dotnet run --project ArmEmulator/ArmEmulator.fsproj`
